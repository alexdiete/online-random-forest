# Online Random Forest Classifier (Java)
This is a Java implementation of an online random forest classifier. Online machine learning enables to update an existing classification model continuously without keeping the processed data available or knowing all data a-priori. This implementation relies on the implementation of [Amir Saffari](https://github.com/amirsaffari/online-random-forests) (C++). We reimplemented this classifier to use it also on wearable devices, e.g., android platforms.

Documentation, Binaries, and Examples are coming soon.
